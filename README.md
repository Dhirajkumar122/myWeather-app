---Weather App
--Overview
This Weather App allows users to view the current weather information for multiple locations. Users can enter the names of the cities they want to check the weather for, and the app will display the temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and local time for each location. The app supports both light and dark modes for user preference.

--Technologies Used
     React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
     OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for cities around the world.
     CSS: Styling language used for designing the user interface.
    FontAwesome: Library for displaying icons in the application.

--Known Issues/Limitations
      Limited to the current weather data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API. No forecast or historical data.
